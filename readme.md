# example-4-ambassador

this is to help give context to a question toward the Ambassador Slack group.

there are 2 services here. They both could hypothetically do different things, but their routes/URLs are identical. 

cats-service.py - a service concerning cats
dogs-service.py - a service concerning dogs

question: is it impossible to disambiguate these services and their routes using Ambassador config?
